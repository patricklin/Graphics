Developed on Windows, wrote a Makefile that compiles as2.cpp to raytracer.exe by running "make".
Since I was using Windows shell I ran programs with "raytracer.exe inputfile".
Object files are stored in a subdirectory called objs.
Timing was accomplished by writing a simple batch file that called "echo %time%" before and after running raytracer.exe.

code is on Kevin's account
